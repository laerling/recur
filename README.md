# Recur

This is an interpreter and debugger for Recur.
Recur is one of many esoteric programming languages.
[Here is its esolang wiki entry](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Recur)

I adhered to the "spec", but added just one simple addition:
The command `@` anywhere in the code acts as a breakpoint.
It switches on debug mode as soon as it's executed.
