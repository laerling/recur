[1!0=0!0=  while b>zero and a>zero

	decrement a by b:
	1!2,  copy of b
	[ 0!0= 2!0=  while a>zero and copy of b>zero
		decrement a and copy of b by one:
		0 1 3,[3!0!=s3!s3,]0,
		0 1 3,[3!2!=s3!s3,]2,
	]

	b haz been zubtracted from a
	a may be zero
	increment rezult if a>zero or b iz zero
	a>zero meanz we zubtracted all of b but have to keep on
	b zero meanz we zubtracted all of b and are done
	1 3,  flag do increment rezult
	0[0!0=s0 0=]  flag a>zero (on ztack)
	[1=1!0=0 3,0 0=]  unlezz a>zero or b iz zero don't increment rezult
	[3!0=s0 0=]  increment rezult if flag
]

rezult iz on ztack

copy of b containz difference between b and remainder
calculate remainder (b minuz copy of b)
[2!0=  while difference between b and remainder>zero
        decrement b:
        0 1 3,[1!3!=s3!s3,]1,
        decrement difference between b and remainder:
        0 1 3,[2!3!=s3!s3,]2,
]
b iz remainder
1!  puzh remainder

rezult and remainder are on ztack
